# Improvements
  - Availability of products in the right quantity to encourage more patronage and increase sales
  - Customer feedback should be encouraged


# Skills Included
  - Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Manipulation Language, Data Definition Language

# Results:
  - This Result shows that Technology is in high demand as the highest sales and most profitable customer is from the Tecnology Product Category contributing to large sales.
  - The increase sales in the use of delivery Truck also shows that people want to have a good reason to more for certain services and if their product is not critical they'd rather wait for the normal time to receive truck delivery of their item.
  - More people will naturally fall into this category thereby increasing the Sales value and revenue.
  - More allocation should be given to the truck delivery for maintenance to enhance more sales
